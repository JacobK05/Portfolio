   <h1 className="about-h1"> About Me </h1>
   <p className="about-p">My name is Jacob Kaufenberg, a motivated 19-year-old high school graduate with a passion for the tech industry. I'm driven to carve out a successful career as a software developer, where I can continually grow and refine my skills. With a solid foundation in programming and a keen eye for detail, I'm eager to tackle challenges head-on and contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.

    Outside of programming, I bring to the table a strong sense of discipline, consistency, and determination. These qualities not only fuel my personal growth but also drive me to excel in every aspect of my professional endeavors.

   While I may not yet possess all the experience or expertise for every role, I am committed to learning and adapting to become the best possible candidate. I believe that with perseverance and dedication, I can contribute significantly to any team and achieve the goals I've set for myself in the dynamic world of technology.         </p>
